# UFOs
Challenge 11


## Overview of Project

This project was to pull all the UFO sightings into a central website allowing interested individuals to conduct searches on multiple criteria to locate infomration about the UFO sightings.  The site needed to be able to filter on all the metadata available, and refresh as users updated their search items.  Lastly, the site needed to be asthetically pleasing to show that the site was not only informative, but professional in nature.


## Results 

The site created allows users expansive search capabilities.  With such a large volume of sittings in our database, this site will allow anyone interested to conduct a search against our database of sightings.  The search criteria include the ability to search by Date, State, City, Country and Shape of the item sighted.  These search criteria can be conducted on the left hand side of the page as seen below.

Conducting searches in the site is very straight forward and easy to use.   Simply enter the search criteria in the left hand side and search results will populate to the right of the search criteria.   The details of the sightings will be contained within that search criteria with all the information available.

Additionally, if it is needed to refine your search, you can continue to enter additioanal criteria in each search field to reduce the volume of items returned.  For example, if you were looking for sightings in CA, but only wanted sightings in and around Fresno, you could refine your search by entering each both the state and the city you are looking for.  See the image below as an example of the functionality.

### In Summary, there are some dissadvantages to this process

Though this site has makes searching for the information very easy, there are a few modifications that would likely make the page work even better.   For example, it's current functionality requires that the user needs to enter the proper capitlization for the items in the search criteria.  Thought this could likely be handled by a statement mentioning that all items need to be in lower case, at times it may present that no search results are available when in fact they are.  See the example image with an upper case "TX":

Though further development may be necessary to refine the process, the site functions very well and will be a big hit in the UFO community!
